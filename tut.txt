Notes 
1. The main difference is that while loops are designed to run while a condition is satisfied and then terminate once that condition returns false. 
On the other hand, until loops are designed to run while the condition returns false and only terminate when the condition returns true.
2. You can only access a function variable externally after the function has been called
